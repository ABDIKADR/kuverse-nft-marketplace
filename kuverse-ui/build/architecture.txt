Architecture Overview:
- User interacts with the React-based UI in their web browser
- The UI uses ethers.js to connect to the Ethereum blockchain
- Smart contracts handle the NFT and marketplace functionality
- Metadata and images are stored on IPFS/Arweave for decentralization

Data Flow:
1. User connects wallet to the UI
2. UI initializes contract instances and loads data 
3. User actions (mint, list, buy) trigger contract calls
4. Contracts emit events that the UI listens for
5. UI updates in real-time based on blockchain state
